## Histogram
- What is histogram?

A frequency distribution shows how often each different value in a set of data occurs. A histogram is the most commonly used graph to show frequency distributions. It looks very much like a bar chart, but there are important differences between them. This helpful data collection and analysis tool is considered one of the seven basic quality tools.

## Histogram Equalization
- What is histogram equalization?

Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram.

## Gaussian filtering
- What is gaussian filtering?

  In electronics and signal processing, a Gaussian filter is a filter whose impulse response is a Gaussian function (or an approximation to it, since a true Gaussian response is physically unrealizable as it has infinite support).In image processing, Gaussian filtering is usually used to obtain images with high signal-to-noise ratio.
